Variables: 

num_leases_in_effect -  Total Number of Leases in Effect
						This table contains the total number of leases, by state, considered “in effect” by the BLM at the end of each fiscal year.

					This table contains the total number of new leases, by state, issued by the BLM during each fiscal year. Leases issued over the course of a fiscal year may or may not be leases sold during that same year. For example, a lease might have been sold but not issued pending protest resolution. Following successful resolution, that lease would have been issued, but this process may not have concluded in the same fiscal year. This figure includes parcels sold at a competitive lease sale, as well as leases issued non-competitively.

acres_leased_yr - 	Number of Acres Leased During the Fiscal Year
					This table contains the total number of acres, by state, contained in new leases issued by the BLM during each fiscal year.

num_wells_spudded_yr - 	Number of Well Bores Started (Spud) During the Fiscal Year on Federal Lands
						This table contains the total number of well bores started (spudded), by state, during each fiscal year. "Spudding in," or to "spud" a well bore, means to begin drilling operations, so a spudded well bore is one where drilling operations have begun.
 
num_of_producible_wells - 	Number of Producible and Service Well Bores on Federal Lands

								This table contains the total number of producible and service completions, by state, during each fiscal year.  Separate service completions are for the benefit of oil and gas operations, such as water disposal, salt water disposal, water injection, gas injection, water source, steam injection, or monitoring.
