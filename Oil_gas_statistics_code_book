Summary of Data Set
--------------------

The BLM manages nearly 700 million acres of mineral estate.  This acreage includes areas where either the BLM or other Federal agencies manage the surface, as well as areas where the surface is privately owned.  For the purposes of the information on this page, these lands are referred to as “Federal lands.”

The BLM compiles a large amount of statistical information relating to oil and gas leasing on Federal lands.  Below are links to tables and spreadsheets with data that include the numbers of BLM-administered oil and gas leases, applications for permit to drill, and oil and gas wells.  Most of the statistics on this page cover Fiscal Years 1988-2015.  The data begin in 1988 because that was the first year the BLM began to issue leases under the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act.  Tables 12 and 13 cover different timeframes.

The definitions on this page apply to the BLM onshore leasing program only.

The Department of the Interior's Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) maintains statistical data for Federal onshore sales volumes and reported royalty revenues




Variables: 

num_leases_in_effect -  Total Number of Leases in Effect
						This table contains the total number of leases, by state, considered “in effect” by the BLM at the end of each fiscal year.

 num_acres_leased_yr -  Total Number of Acres Under Lease as of the Last Day of the Fiscal year
						This table contains the total number of acres, by state, contained in leases considered “in effect” by the BLM at the end of each fiscal year.

num_new_leases_yr - Number of New Leases Issued During the Fiscal Year
					This table contains the total number of new leases, by state, issued by the BLM during each fiscal year. Leases issued over the course of a fiscal year may or may not be leases sold during that same year. For example, a lease might have been sold but not issued pending protest resolution. Following successful resolution, that lease would have been issued, but this process may not have concluded in the same fiscal year. This figure includes parcels sold at a competitive lease sale, as well as leases issued non-competitively.

acres_leased_yr - 	Number of Acres Leased During the Fiscal Year
					This table contains the total number of acres, by state, contained in new leases issued by the BLM during each fiscal year.

num_producing_leases -  Number of Producing Leases on Federal Lands
						This table contains the total number of producing leases by state as of the last day of the fiscal year.  

num_producing_acres - 	Number of Producing Acres on Federal Lands
						This table contains the total number of acres by state covered by producing leases as of the last day of the fiscal year.


num_wells_spudded_yr - 	Number of Well Bores Started (Spud) During the Fiscal Year on Federal Lands
						This table contains the total number of well bores started (spudded), by state, during each fiscal year. "Spudding in," or to "spud" a well bore, means to begin drilling operations, so a spudded well bore is one where drilling operations have begun.
 
num_of_producible_wells - 	Number of Producible and Service Well Bores on Federal Lands
							This table contains the total number of producible well bores by state as of the end of each fiscal year.  A well bore is considered producible if the well bore is capable of production. 


num_of_producible_completions - Number of Producible and Service Completions on Federal Lands
								This table contains the total number of producible and service completions, by state, during each fiscal year.  Separate service completions are for the benefit of oil and gas operations, such as water disposal, salt water disposal, water injection, gas injection, water source, steam injection, or monitoring.



*** Not being used since information is not available for every state ***

num_drill_permits_aproved_yr - 	Number of Drilling Permits Approved by Fiscal Year on Federal Lands
								This table contains the total number of Applications for Permit to Drill (APDs) by state approved by the BLM each fiscal year.  Oil and gas operators may not begin drilling activities on a lease without an approved APD.  Note that a single lease may have multiple APDs approved and each well pad may have one or more APDs.
