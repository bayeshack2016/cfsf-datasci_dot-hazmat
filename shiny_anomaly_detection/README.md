This isn't done yet, but in case my Data Science Working Group, Code for SF, and/or Bayes Hack friends would ocassionally like to see my progress, go here:  

### [Shiny + R DoT Anomaly Detector >>](https://judec.shinyapps.io/shiny_anomaly_detection/)

### Latest Update: 7/26/16  

*v1.12 - Starting to add functionality and interactivity*  

* UI's tableOutput now working and soon to be reactive
* SERVER's Leaflet map rendering now working, with variable polygon opacity, and soon to be reactive
* Need to make both of the above reactive to user's month selection
* Need to make state-specific incident timeline and summary (bottom columns) reactive to user's Leaflat map clicks

#### SEO tags, because, well, why not? :)
